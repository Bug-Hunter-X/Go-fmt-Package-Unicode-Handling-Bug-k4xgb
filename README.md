# Go fmt Package Unicode Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in the Go standard library's `fmt` package related to how it handles Unicode characters in string formatting operations.  The bug manifests under specific conditions involving certain Unicode code points, causing unexpected behavior or crashes.

The `bug.go` file contains the buggy code, and `bugSolution.go` provides a corrected version that avoids the issue.  The problem arises when specific Unicode characters are passed to `fmt.Printf` or similar functions. The solution involves careful handling of string encoding and potential fallback mechanisms.
